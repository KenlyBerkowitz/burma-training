# burma-training

This program is used as a training program for a local restaurant in Oakland, CA. 
It has helped train people about their knowledge of the menu. The program features two types
of flash card programs, differing in menu size, and three tests to determine the
scores of employee knowledge. It inputs the menu into a structured array from an external
.txt file. The program uses a class to keep track of the amount of times a dish is called
and returns a boolean to determine if the program should output the dish. Furthermore, it
makes use of dynamically allocated arrays,object-oriented programming, various data structures
and STL vectors.
